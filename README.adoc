== Description
This is a simple todo microservice written in Java. The core of the application is extremely simple, but the
intention is to show the use of an app that

- exposes open tracing,
- links tracing to logs,
- exposes metrics for prometheus
- uses a feature toggle service
- has a feature in progress and it is testable by the FT service

It also shows how
- a proper Maven reactor build should work in CD environment,
- separation of dependencies for ease of consistency across your project
- Maven being able to provide reliable node 

This example application is using Java 11.
