== Documentation

This project also includes feature toggle service integration to demonstrate how back-end functionality can be toggled in production based on a feature status. 

Feature toggled functionality: 

Feature name: "FEATURE_TITLE_TO_UPPERCASE"

If "FEATURE_TITLE_TO_UPPERCASE" is enabled - it will convert todo 'title' property to uppercase for every todo in the response for add/list/delete/resolve operations.  

If this feature is disabled it will have todo 'title' in whatever format it was sent when a todo was created.
